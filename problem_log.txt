Inconsistencies in street names - abbreviations, input error, parts outside of San Francisco, capitalizations

Van Ness is Van Ness Avenue
Bridgeway is fine
Cavalla Cay is fine, it's in Novato
Caribe Isle - in Novato
Remove #XXX from end of street names
Ctr -> Center
MILLSBRAE AVE -> Change capitialization 
MacDonald is MacDonald Avenue
Everything after street label should be something else, like the suite, building labels
Check "Mason" on mini
Remove SF 80 PM 4.5 - probably input error here
Broadway is just Broadway

Postal code inconsistencies - input error with CA in front, outside of SF

No bad IDs or UIDs

node tag - highway crossings have [stop, traffic_signal, uncontrolled], turn restrictions
