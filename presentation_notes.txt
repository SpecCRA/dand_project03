Map data - San Francisco and a little bit of the surrounding areas

Problems with data
-inconsistent street names
    -abbreviations
    -inconsistent capitalization
    -incomplete entries
-amenities
    -different ways to say the asme thing
    -fixed typos
-shops
    -fixed similar categories
    -fixed typos
    -made capitalization consistent within values
-cuisines
    -same as shops
    -special cases are plurals and singulars 
-postcodes
    -some start with CA
    -everything else is pretty good

What statistics?
-file sizes
-number of unique contributors
-total number of nodes and ways
-how many of each category of amenity, shop, cuisine
-how many one ways compared to how many streets? ("k" = oneway)

Additional ideas
-most populated cuisines
-how many cafes
-how many no left turns (k=restriction v=no_left_turn)
    -because san francisco is known for not being able to turn left anywhere
-just how many starbucks are there in San Francisco?

Improve data or analysis
-narrower or broader categories for amenities or shops, some places simply require local knowledge to properly categorize
-ways to deal with subcategories in shops and cuisines because i oversimplified it
